## Protocol


This project aims to create a working game-server / client-modification for a popular MMO (can you guess which one? :P).
You can find more information on how it works in the subprojects of entice. If you're interested in using the API, you
can find the complete documentation here in this repository.

* Milestones - These define the features we implemented and are working on
* Routes - The public & secured HTTP API for the server
* Topics - The secured Websocket API for the server as an overview. This is the place to start when you are looking
for how things of this server work internally (API wise).
